# iOS Player using MobileVLCKit for test purposes

I had to remove the Pod folder, so to run the project, you have to run `pod install` before building it.<br>
When building it into a device, set `enable bitcode` to `false`. <br>
When creating your own project using this library the files: `empty.cpp` and `empty.hpp`, must be in your root folder.
